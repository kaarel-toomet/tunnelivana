# tunnelivana

A Minecraft-inspired 2D game, with weird textures and lots of random stuff

## How to play

- ASDW or ↑←↓→ to move / jump
- E or . to craft (or eat)
- Walk into blocks to break them (some directions in some blocks don't work)
- Right click to build
- Left click on monsters to kill them
- R to teleport to your spawnpoint
- Left click on cats while holding algae to set your spawnpoint and have the cat chase you for 1 minute
- Y to throw onions
- Lifes, gold, and monster ruins are shown to the right of the hotbar
- Scroll to select items
- Fire can melt stuff
- Floating islands exist
- There is no world choosing system yet, so if you have multiple worlds, you have to rename world folders
- Close the game to save (requires a folder named `world`)
- K to toggle if you can break or not

## TODO
- [ ] Save choosing system
- [ ] Water system support limited amounts of fluids (and water and waterfalls on floating islands)
- [ ] Optimizations
- [ ] Refactoring
- [ ] Better light system
- [ ] Balancing
 - [ ] A reason you need to make pear vaults (pear thieves?)
- [ ] Saving monsters and time
- [ ] Breaking delay
- [ ] Monsters harder to kill (health)
